				<font size="4"><font face= "verdana" color="black"> On April 10th, 2019 Scientists released the first ever captured image of a black hole using the worldwide telescope system known as the Event Horizon Telescope, or (EHT). To many people this image is simply something interesting, but to physicists and other scientists this is 
				 a revolutionary scientific accomplishment. What so many people thought could never be done has been achieved, and this image is just one example of the significant technological progress mankind has made.</font></font>

			<p>
				<font size="4"><font face= "verdana" color="black">For the better part of a century Black Holes were based solely off of theoretical existence. A black hole is defined as a region of spacetime exhibiting such gravitational effects that not even light can escape from its domain. The first scientist to propose the existence of a black hole was Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, and he based his proposal off of a modern solution to the theory of general relativity. It would be until 1958 however that David Finkelstein would interpret said entity as a tangible region of space.</font></font>
