					Through the first two months of the NBA season it seemed as if Dallas had won the draft night trade that  
					brought Luka Doncic, the Hawks' 3rd overall pick, to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Dallas's 5th pick 
					Trae Young and a top-5 protected pick in the 2019 NBA draft. This trade would send shock-waves through social 
					media, with most sports outlets thrashing the Hawks for trading away who most people considered to be a 
					generational player, for a Boom or Bust player such as Trae Young. During Young's first and only season at
					Oklahoma, he would become the first player in NCAA history to lead the league in scoring and assists.
					While Young was an impressive college prospect, there were many concerns about how he would translate to the NBA. 
					Standing at about 6 feet and 2 inches in shoes weighing around 180 lbs, Trae Young's nimble frame was an area of 
					concern for most NBA scouts. During the NBA combine Trae Young would impress many scouts, but none seemed to have as much faith
					in him as Hawks General Manager Travis Schlenck. Schlenck became the Hawks general manager in 2017 after parting ways with
					the Golden State Warriors, and was a large part in drafting John Collins, the 19th overall pick in the 2017 draft. 
					Anyone who watches the NBA can tell you the Schlenck has a keen eye for talent, as he helped establish the Golden State 
					Warriors rule over the NBA. Working with Steph Curry, Schlenck saw Young's jaw dropping shooting ability and knew he 
					was the guy to bring Atlanta back into playoff contention. With Schlenck's departure from Golden State he brought in 
					Lloyd Pierce from the Philadelphia 76ers, and player development professionals from Golden State
